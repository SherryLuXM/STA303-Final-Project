# STA303-Final-Project
Fitness Tracker customer and product research--STA303 Methods of Data Analysis II

For project information, please go to **https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-final-project/outsiders.html**

## Resources:
* Set up Jupyter Notebook: https://rstudio-with-jupyerhub-uoft.netlify.app/#5
* Use R Markdown: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/

## Current Status:
* Datasets loaded, waiting for more instructions.
* The post code data isn't allowed to be uploaded directly on Github. You can go to https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/collections/numeric-data/census-canada/postal-code-conversion-file/2016. The August 2021 .sav file is used, because it is the newest and we have 2021 concensus data to use it with.
* Issues with the knitted rmd can be ignored, like cover page loading. It will be updated when the project template is provided.
